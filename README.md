tvheadend.bundle V.0.1 (09 July 2013)
================

HTS-TVHeadend channel for Plex Media Server

This Channel takes the http streams from TVheadend and displays them in your PHT/PMC client.

What does it do for now?

It supports direct stream from TVheadend from a directly taken stream : example http://user:password@server:port/stream/channelid/number
It has some support for using TVheadend as encoder/transcoder (this need's some tweaking and an git version of tvheadend with transcoding enabled).
Preferences for username, password, port, enable/disable transcoding. (For some reason after editing the Preferences PMS has to be restarted, this needs to be fixed)
It only works in PHT och PLEX Media Client on OSX Win Linux for now.

Thanks TO:
